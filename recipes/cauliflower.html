        <h1>All-Dressed-Up Cauliflower Rice</h1>
        <img src="../img/cauliflower.jpg" alt="Cauliflower with rice and cream">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A vegan weeknight dinner of fluffy, textured cauliflower with warm spices from chef Sophia Roe, the host of Counter Space on Vice. For distinct bits of cauliflower that won’t turn into mush once they’re cooked, don’t overcrowd the bowl of your food processor. Doctor up your cauliflower rice with toasted pine nuts or almonds, dates or dried currants, lots of fresh herbs, unsweetened coconut flakes, or chopped fresh chile.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium head of cauliflower, broken into florets</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium red bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
            <li>3/4 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp. finely grated lime zest</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp. coconut sugar or granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted, roasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped mint, plus torn leaves for serving</li>
            <li>Plain whole-milk Greek yogurt and lime wedges (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Working in 2 batches, pulse cauliflower in a food processor until pieces are about the size of rice (you don’t want to overprocess; err on the large side). Transfer cauliflower to a medium bowl lined with a kitchen towel to absorb any extra moisture.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add bell pepper, shallot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallot and garlic are softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in curry powder, turmeric, and coriander and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add coconut milk, lime zest, lime juice, and coconut sugar; season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add cauliflower and raisins; cook, tossing occasionally, until cauliflower is just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed.</li>
            <li>Add cilantro, pumpkin seeds, and ¼ cup mint to cauliflower rice and toss to combine. Divide among bowls; top with a dollop of yogurt if using and torn mint. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over if desired.</li>
        </ol>
