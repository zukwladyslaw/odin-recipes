        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This may be the easiest and most delicious homemade pasta recipe in my current arsenal. I know we are all familiar with classic green pesto, but have you ever heard of RED PESTO? Mind blowing, I know.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, red pesto offers way more complexity and oomph than green. I find most green pestos to just taste very earthy with garlicky undertones. Red pesto, however, is incredibly bright with rich notes of umami. Itâ€™s delicious on its own, or paired with just about any protein: grilled chicken, shrimp, steak, or meatballs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. dry pasta of choice</li>
            <li>1 roasted red pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pitted green olives</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. pine nuts</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta in salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water prior to draining.</li>
            <li>While pasta cooks, combine roasted red pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, green olives, pine nuts, Parmesan, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Blend until smooth while gradually streaming in olive oil.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta and return to pot. Add pesto and 1/2 cup reserved pasta water; stir continuously until pesto begins clinging to noodles. Add more pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Garnish pasta with additional Parmesan cheese and basil, and serve with sauteed veggies or protein of choice, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
